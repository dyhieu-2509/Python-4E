Explain each of the following using an example of a human capability:
(1) Central processing unit, (2) Main Memory, (3) Secondary Memory, (4) Input Device, and (5) Output Device. For
example, “What is the human equivalent to a Central Processing Unit”?

(1) If in humans, the CPU is the brain. Everything is processed before being sent.
(2) If in humans, RAM is the Main memory, humans store it in the brain and the brain store informations claimed into neurons and synapses
(3) If in humans, hard drive (HDD, SSD) is the Secondary Memory. The availability to remember long-term even small details compare with Secondary memory.
(4) If in humans, 4 senses ( eyes, nose, mouth, ear) is the input device
(5) If in humans, the output device is the availability to see and talk.
